BMP Image Processor
This C-based utility performs pixel-level manipulation on 24-bit uncompressed BMP images. It serves as a foundation for understanding binary file structures, metadata handling, and digital image processing.

Project Overview
The application opens a source Bitmap (BMP) file, parses its headers to ensure compatibility, and iterates through the pixel data to apply conditional color changes. The current implementation identifies specific color values and replaces them during the copy process.
